                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>I’m Stelios, a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in web development. I have
                        been working in law enforcement since 2002 until today. I also from 2020 to 2024 managed gaming
                        projects, gaining
                        experience in leadership, organization, and project management. Currently, I am learning HTML
                        and
                        CSS,
                        with plans to expand into JavaScript and Python, creating functional and visually appealing web
                        applications. My background has strengthened my discipline, problem-solving, and communication
                        skills,
                        which I now apply to my growing career in web development.</p>
